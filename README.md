ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Thanks for taking on the Blinkist Android Code Challenge.

Please include the following information in this README:

- Instructions on how to run the project.
- Your focus areas during development and any trade-offs you made, along with the reasons behind
  them.
- Specify the areas you primarily focused on, such as the architecture, data flow, UI, or any other
  aspect.
- Explain any trade-offs you made and provide your reasoning behind them.
- Highlight the skills and areas of expertise that you believe are best exhibited in your project.
- List any third-party libraries, copied-in code, or dependencies you used.
- Clarify the source of the code you've included in your project, differentiating between code
  written specifically for this project and code written at another time or by others. If you are
  simply referencing a dependency via a dependency manager, you don't need to mention it here.
- Include any other noteworthy information that you believe is relevant for evaluating the project.
- Lastly, please refrain from using AI to generate the README, as it does not provide any indication
  of your written communication style and may result in rejection of your challenge.
